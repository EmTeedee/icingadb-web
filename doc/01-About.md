# About Icinga DB Web

**Icinga DB Web** pushes your monitoring stack to the next level.

Based on the lessons learnt with the base monitoring module, it offers a modern
and streamlined design to provide a clear and concise overview of your monitoring
environment.

## New Features

### Multiple List Layouts

The new view switcher widget displayed in the controls of lists allows to change their layout.
The majority of lists use this to switch between various levels of detail. The service list
below for example uses it to show a check's output differently.
